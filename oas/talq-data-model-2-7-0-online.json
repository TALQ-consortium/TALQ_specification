These values are the recommended keys which should be used in the current version and will be the only accepted in the next MAJOR release: *headerMissing*: An expected header is missing at the request. Ex: `talq-api-version` header missing.; *headerValueNotValid*: A received header has a not valid value. Ex: `talq-api-version` header value (2.1.0) is not the expected (2.2.0).; *parameterMissing*: An expected parameter is missing at the request. Ex: `clientAddress` is missing.; *parameterValueNotValid*: The received parameter has a not valid value. Ex: The `clientAddress` is not valid.; *payloadError*: The payload has some error as it is not as defined in the TALQ Specification.  Ex: The device payload without `deviceAddress` is not as defined by the OAS DM file (`deviceAddress` is a required attribute).; *resourceNotFound*: The referred resource by the request is not found.; *resourceConflict*: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. Ex: A PUT request over a device with a function not included in its device class is erroneously sent.; *relatedResourceNotFound*: A resource related to an entity's attribute is not found. Ex: A `LampActuatorFunction.calendarID` is sent for a missing Calendar.; *deletingResourceIsReferred*: This error happens when a DELETE request tries to delete a resource that is referred by other entity. Ex: A DELETE request for a given calendar fails because this calendar is used by some LampActuators.; *serviceConstraintExceeded*: The service constraint has been surpassed. Ex: More calendars than the allowed by the `'maximumCalendars'` ControlService constraint has been created by the request.; *assignmentEntityNotValid*: The entity assigned to the referred resource is not valid. Ex: An assign command tries to assign a LampType, with `DALI` control type, to a given LampActuator, but the actual hardware is `1-10V` controlled.; *assignmentAddressNotValid*: The referred resource does not have any function appropriate to the assigned entity. Ex: An assign command tries to assign a calendar to a device without actuator functions.; *overrideCommandNotValid*: The command sent to the referred resource is not valid. Ex: An override command sends a command with a level state impossible to apply to the referred actuator function (level=77% when the actual lamp does not have this precision).; *overrideAddressNotValid*: The referred resource does not have any function appropriate to the override command. Ex: An override command tries to send a command to a device without actuator functions.; *genericError*: This error represents a fallback for any unexpected or unspecified issue that occurs during request processing. It is returned when no other defined error type applies. This typically indicates an unforeseen condition on the server. Ex: A request might encounter a server timeout or an unforeseen internal failure that does not have a specific error category.",

For example, a specific location (latitude, longitude) of a device could be defined by the vendor. If the device is equipped with a GPS, it could send a specific event indicating that its position is different to the one defined by the CMS. We might also want to let the configuration to the vendor itself and simply define events notifying the CMS that the default configuration has changed. For example, a garbage bin could have its location defined based on a sensor placed on the floor. If the bin is not above this sensor, the vendor will trigger an event. In this last case, the CMS does not need to configure anything. ",

Likewise, if the text string overflows the display size, the text \"wraps around\" and displays on the next line down or, if the last line has been written, wraps around to the top of the display. Brightness and Contrast controls are provided to allow control of various display types including STN and DSTN type LCD character displays.

                "description": "The lamp type consists of a set of attributes that together characterize a given lamp and control gear combination. When modelling a Lighting ODN with many luminaires, there are attributes' values that are the same for many lamps, e.g.: the expected consumed power of the lamp and control gear (wattage) would be the same for many lamp monitors. The concept of LampType is created to avoid including the same attributes' values in every lamp monitor and actuator of the same type, for this reason a reference to a lamp type is included in the lamp actuator and lamp monitor functions, as these attributes are required for proper operation of these functions. Thus, the definition of lamp types enables the CMS to efficiently set attributes in many lamp actuators/monitors by just setting the address of the “lampType” attribute in each function. Lamp types can be created by both CMS and TALQ Gateway as separate entities. The TALQ Gateway shall announce any lamp type it has to the CMS as part of the initial configuration. In addition to the initial configuration, the TALQ Gateway shall also announce the lamp type whenever it changes. The CMS may also send lamp types to the TALQ Gateway. [DEPRECATED: : This type has been deprecated and it will be removed in the next MAJOR release. Please use the new LuminaireType, BracketType, DriverType and ControllerType instead.]",

Given an example absolute active period, sent by the CMS, of 20:00 to 6:00 assigned to Day1: If dayOffset=0 (midnight to midnight) the active period is split into two absolute time intervals, in the Gateway, one starting at 0:00 to 6:00 and other from 20:00 to 0:00, both on Day1. If dayOffset=12 (noon to noon) the absolute active period starts at 20:00 on Day1 and ends at 6:00 on the next day. If startTime is equal to endTime, it means the full day period is active. This full-day period can be from noon to noon, or midnight to midnight, based on the dayOffset.",
