Dear Smart City Innovator,

If you have arrived here, it means that you know the potential of our TALQ protocol and consider its integration into your smart city solutions. We invite you to join the TALQ Consortium and participate in our [certification program](https://www.talq-consortium.org/2-why-talq/certification/). 

By becoming a member, you will gain access to a wealth of resources, including technical support, a testing tool, and collaboration opportunities with other industry leaders. Moreover, as a member of the TALQ Consortium, you will be able to certify your products.

TALQ Certification confirms that a product has implemented the TALQ protocol according to the TALQ specification. Only products which have been officially certified by the TALQ Consortium are permitted to carry the TALQ-certified logo, signalling to customers and stakeholders alike that your offerings meet the highest standards of interoperability and performance.

We encourage you to explore the possibilities that membership in the TALQ Consortium holds for your organization and to join us in shaping the future of smart cities.

For more information on how to become a member of the TALQ Consortium and participate in our certification program, please [visit our website](https://www.talq-consortium.org/4-contact/).
